Visaul Studio is not very helpful to create ico files (Icon files). It cannot edit anything with 24bit color or higher, for example.

To work around this:
- Create Icon file
- Add icon items for
  - 16x16 24bit
  - 32x32 24bit
  - 48x48 24bit
  - 64x64 24bit
- Remove all other image types
- Build images in other editors or use a converter
- Open then copy/paste the images into the correct resolutions
- Use the Editor to set the transparent color within the image (as needed).

I am using the icons from Microsofts Visual Studio 2022 image library.
The SVC format files are Web friendly vector graphics and will scale well.
The site https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-ico will be able to convert and scale the SVC files.
This site takes one SVG and produces a ICO file with one image of the specified scale.
As such, the same SVG file will need to be processed multiple times for each desired resolution.
The site limits the number of conversions to 10 a day for free.

Note: Icon's are being added to the Application Resources. However, the WinForms takes Icon file
and creates its own resource file for each form. As a result, changing the Icon file or the
icon in the resource file does not change the icon on the form.
