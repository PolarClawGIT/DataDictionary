Visaul Studio is not very helpful to create ico files (Icon files). It cannot edit anything with 24bit color or higher, for example.

To work around this:
- Create Icon file
- Add icon items for
  - 16x16 24bit
  - 32x32 24bit
  - 48x48 24bit
  - 64x64 24bit
- Remove all other image types
- Build images in other editors or use a converter
- Open then copy/paste the images into the correct resolutions
- Use the Editor to set the transparent color within the image (as needed).

I am using the icons from Microsofts Visual Studio 2022 image library.
The SVC format files are Web friendly vector grahpics and will scale well.
The site https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-ico will be able to convert and scale the SVC files.
This site takes one SVG and produces a ICO file with one image of the specfied scale.
As such, the same SVG file will need to be processed muliple times for each disired resolution.
The site limits the number of conversions to 10 a day for free.
